			Hey there! My name is James Wolff, I am a self taught developer and a gamer. Most of my development knowledge is focused around Java, however I know quite a bit about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. I am currently in the process of learning Python with C(# probably) followed closely behind (how backwards is that?)!
		</p>
		<p>I got my first computer when I was 8 and that is when I started doing this, well not this more like <a href="{{ site.url }}/media/helpmego.png">this</a>, but you gotta start somewhere right? Around the time I turned 11 I started tinkering with Javascript and PHP and this was my first introduction to "real" programming. In 2011 when I was 15 I got <strong><em>really</em></strong> into minecraft, as most people around that age did (and still do). Within a year (around the release of 1.4) I took to running my own server most likely because of some power fantasy that I was in control, blah blah blah. Anyway, running my own server introduced me to <a href="https://bukkit.org">Bukkit</a> and it's wonderful community of developers and server owners. I soon took <a href="https://github.com/jwolff52/RankUp">to</a> <a href="https://github.com/jwolff52/AutoDisconnect">writing</a> <a href="https://github.com/jwolff52/LiveBroadcast">my</a> <a href="https://github.com/jwolff52/WelcomeBook">own</a> <a href="https://github.com/jwolff52/TimberEssentials">plugins</a>. Some of them are attempts to recreate other plugins, but most of them were their own projects and, while not necessarily original ideas, original implementations. However all good things come to an end and my server died, more acurately, my several attempts at running servers failed and I soon realized that I didn't like playing the base game all that much. Mods made it better and Harcore Questing Maps and map packs were a lot of fun, but there is only so much enjoyment you can get out of something and, while I still go back on occasion and play for a bit I don't have near as much interest in the game.</p>
		<p>The next "fad" that I jumped on was streaming. I did it fairly frequently and was pretty active with a small community of about 100 people, but between school, my part time job and my love of programming I was never quite able to give my stream the time or attention it deserved, eventually I stopped streaming games and started streaming development starting out with a <a href="https://github.com/jwolff52/BotDuck/tree/f822644a692c938af0acb72fe989e9a7dfc0632f">personal chat moderation bot</a> (note that this bot was originally written in <code>mIRC</code>, ported to <code>Java</code>, then rewritten to be more like my next project), but I soon relized that I wanted to do something bigger, enter <a href="https://github.com/PCMRBot/PCMRBot">PCMRBot</a>, a universally avaliable bot designed to rival nightbot, one problem, the people I was working on the project with had big heads<a href="https://github.com/PCMRBot/PCMRBot/commit/7716acfc162a4964bfb5d6219be2afee85dab8ba"><sup>[1]</sup></a>, liked to take a lot of credit for not so much work, so I left that project (sort of, I still technically own the repo, but <em>shrug</em>) and started <a href="https://github.com/WeeboBot/WeeboBot">WeeboBot</a>! This involved a major rewrite of the code base and, after bringing on an old friend, the addition of some new features, I won't say the project is in <em>active</em> development, but it is definitely still being developed!</p>
		<p>And that brings us to where we are today! Thanks for reading through this check out my <a href="{{ site.url }}/portfolio"> for a list of my major projects!</p>
