			Hey there! My name is James Wolff, I am a self taught developer and a gamer. Most of my development knowledge is focused around Java, however I know quite a bit about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. I am currently in the process of learning Python with C(++ probably) followed closely behind (how backwards is that?)!

		<p>I got my first computer when I was 8 and that is when I started doing this, well not this more like <a href="{{ site.url }}/media/helpmego.png">this</a>, but you gotta start somewhere right? Around the time I turned 11 I started tinkering with Javascript and PHP and this was my first introduction to "real" programming. In 2011 when I was 15 I got <strong><em>really</em></strong> into minecraft, as most people around that age did (and still do). Within a year (around the release of 1.4) I took to running my own server most likely because of some power fantasy that I was in control, blah blah blah. Anyway, running my own server introduced me to <a href="https://bukkit.org">Bukkit</a> and it's wonderful community of developers and server owners. I soon took <a href="https://github.com/jwolff52/RankUp">to</a> <a href="https://github.com/jwolff52/AutoDisconnect">writing</a> <a href="https://github.com/jwolff52/LiveBroadcast">my</a> <a href="https://github.com/jwolff52/WelcomeBook">own</a> <a href="https://github.com/jwolff52/TimberEssentials">plugins</a>. Some of them are attempts to recreate other plugins, but most of them were their own projects and, while not necessarily original ideas, original implementations.</p>
		<p>However all good things come to an end and my server died, more acurately, my several attempts at running servers failed and I soon realized that I didn't like playing the base game all that much. Mods made it better and Harcore Questing Maps and map packs were a lot of fun, but there is only so much enjoyment you can get out of something and, while I still go back on occasion and play for a bit I don't have near as much interest in the game. The next "fad" that I jumpped on was streaming. I did it fairly frequently and was pretty active with a small community of about 100 people</p>
