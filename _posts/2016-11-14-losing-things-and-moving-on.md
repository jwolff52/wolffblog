Well then, it has been quite the month. The company I was working for shut down and I just got back from a trip to Indiana yesterday so I haven't really had all that much of a chance to apply for jobs and can I just say that, while I am extremly greatful for it, it's really tough to live off unemployment...sometimes I wish I was better (or rather even slightly ok) at art and could do comissions...oh well<!--more-->.

So where are we at now? My last check bounced from work, but they just payed it finally, so that is good...though they still owe me for two weeks of work, which I doubt I'll get, but it's not worth the fight (around $1600). I sent out a few applications this morning and am hoping to hear back from them soon, in the meantime I may have a couple small A/V gigs which would pay a bit and delivery for a florist which has payed pretty well in the past so there's that.

This is all short term of course, I need a plan and I have had a history of those not working out too well. Out of highschool I got into a private university only to have to drop out a semester later for financial reasons. The beginning of this year I started at a technical college, only for it to [shut down in September](http://gizmodo.com/itt-is-officially-closing-1786243058). The plan is for me to pay off the debt I owe to the local community college from me doing concurrent enrollment in highschool and get a CS degree there, but really I just want to get some certifications and get a tech support position. I don't have the creativity to start my own company and I don't see myself coming up with "the next big thing" so that is where I am at. I have a pretty big project that, if it takes off, could be a pretty big life changer for me, but really I don't want to put all of my eggs in the biggest maybe of my entire life.

Just needed to get that off my chest, stay tuned for more Java tutorials and maybe something special!
