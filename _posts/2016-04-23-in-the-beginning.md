Hello everyone! So this is where it all begins, huh? Anyway enough rambling I suppose you want to know what this site is about. Well I use this site mainly for rambling about programming as well as book reviews, I read <em>a lot</em> of shitty SciFi books, plus a [portfolio]({{ site.url }}/portfolio) for all of my projects, most of which are Open Source and avaliable on [my github](http://github.com/jwolff52)!<!--more--> <sup>(I also apparently use it for non-sequitur statements)</sup>

I think that pretty much sums everything up. Many of my posts may be this short, though the book reviews may get a little...ugly so stick around and enjoy the view, it's free!
