Now that you have your development environment set up and ready to go it is time to write your first program! When you first open up IDEA you will be greeted with a window like the one below.

Click "Create New Project" and a new dialog will appear. Ensure that on the left you have "Java" selected then in the top right you should see a "New..." button, click that then select "JDK". Navigate to the root directory of the JDK you installed in the last step, on windows it should be something like "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.x_xxx", if you aren't sure where it installed on your OS [a quick google search](https://www.google.com/search?q=where+did+the+JDK+install) should help you out, if you still aren't sure leave a comment below! Once you have selected that path it should populate and auto select in the dropdown next to the "New..." button. Click the next button at the bottom to continue.

  <li>If you are using IntelliJ IDEA you may not see as many options avaliable on this screen because you are using the free version, we won't be using any of these so not to worry! <a class="anchor" name="fn-1" href="#cont-1">â†µ</a></li>
