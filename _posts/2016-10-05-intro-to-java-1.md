The goal of this tutorial series is to be an introduction to Java as a programming language. Java was the first language I learned so this tutorial will be designed for the ultimate beginner, though I won't teach you how to use a computer and install programs :wink:.

The first decision you will need to make is what type of editor you want to use, be it generic text editor like [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) or [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/), or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like [Eclipse](https://eclipse.org/), [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), or [Netbeans](https://netbeans.org/). All of the options listed above have syntax highlighting which can make your code more readable turning something like this:

```
public static void main(Stirng[] args) {

}
```
 into something like this:
 
 ```java
 public static void main(Stirng[] args) {

}
```
