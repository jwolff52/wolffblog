A new day a new class and more working overnight (I cannot wait to get out of this hell-hole) Today we talked about some basic network security and a lot of what the teacher said reminded me of [this XKCD](http://xkcd.com/936)<!--more-->.

Now I won't claim to be a professional (clearly I am not), however this has always been my <sup>[second](http://xkcd.com/1133)</sup> favorite XKCD comic (or really just comic in general), but my instructor raised an interesting point tonight. With so many password keeping programs out there today ([LastPass](https://lastpass.com/) and [KeePass](https://keepass.info) come to mind) why are we still having this discussion?
