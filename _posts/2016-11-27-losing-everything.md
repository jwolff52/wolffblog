Welp this is the *perfect* way to wrap up this month! I lost my house...or rather was kicked out. You see I've been on unemployment for a couple months and looking for office jobs, anything office related, but nothing has turned up, bummer<!--more-->. I was told by my parents that I could continue applying for office jobs until January and then after that I would just have to get a job anywhere, well I guess January came early and I don't actually get that chance to apply anywhere, woot! So here I am sitting in a McDonald's, hoping one of my friends lets me bum their couch for super cheap...wish me luck!
