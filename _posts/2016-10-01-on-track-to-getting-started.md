Look at that wonderful human specimen, oh sorry I seem to have...nope that's the right picture? Oh...

That's right I am not exactly in the best shape, and that is just what is on the surface. I am at risk of High Blood Pressure (HBP) and my family has a frequent history of diabetes and heart problems. After having my appendix removed last year and then just last week going to the hospital because of pain that was possibly a heart attack I have decided it is time to change<!--more-->.

Once a week, hopefully every Saturday, I will be creating a post with a table like the one below[^1]: This post will only have this one week, but from now on I will keep four weeks consistent in a post and a monthly average at the bottom of each post.

{:.table .table-striped .table-bordered .table-condensed}
|Fitness Stats    | 09/25 - 10/01 |
|-----------------|---------------|
| Caloric Intake  |   Unsure      |
| Distance Ridden |   27 miles    |
| Weight Start    |   260.2 lbs   |
| Weight End      |   261.3 lbs   |

So with this being the first week and not realizing till today I was gonna post about this I don't really have a lot of tracked info. I have been eating quite a bit better than normal this week, but I have no easy way to go back and track anything. I did go for a very small ride last night and a *bit* more substantial one this morning, though I plan to start doing 3-4 rides a week, eventually doing 30+ miles per ride.

Basically the reason I'm doing this is to force myself to stay on top of it. It's just one way for me  to stay on top of this problem before it, quite literally, kills me.
