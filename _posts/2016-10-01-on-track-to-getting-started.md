Look at that wonderful human specimen, oh sorry I seem to have...nope that's the right picture? Oh...

That's right I am not exactly in the best shape, and that is just what is on the surface. I am at risk of High Blood Pressure (HBP) and my family has a frequent history of diabetes and heart problems. After having my appendix removed last year and then just last week going to the hospital because of pain that was possibly a heart attack I have decided it is time to change.
