			is a twitch chat moderation bot written in Java using <a href="http://www.jibble.org/pircbot.php">PIrcBot</a>. It is currently in development at this time. The project is approximately 60% complete with majority of the functionality implementation left to be done on the <a href="http://weebo.jameswolff.me">Web frontend</a>. There is also a sister-project <a href="http://github.com/WeeboBot/DWeeboBot">DWeeboBot</a> which is the Discord variation on the bot itself. This project uses <a href="http://github.com/austinv11/Discord4J">Discord4J</a> to communicate with the Discord API and was just started in September of 2016. It is still in the early stages of development with the first "working version" planned to be ready by December of 2016.

			<a href="http://github.com/jwolff52/discordoragi"><img src="{{ site.url }}/media/no_image.gif" alt="Discordoragi project image"><strong class="project-title">DISCORDORAGI</strong></a>
			is a bot for Discord written in Python using <a href="http://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py">discord.py</a>. The bot is a fork of a Reddit bot called <a href="http://github.com/Nihilate/Roboragi">Roboragi</a> which fetches Anime, Manga, and Light Novels from various databases and returns a formatted answer with various information. An example of an anime request from both bots can be found <a href="http://puu.sh/qBKij/d1eaa3b31c.png">here</a> and <a href="http://puu.sh/qBKza/2d47d49bfb.png">here</a>. One of the largest issues is that Discord does not support links in their Markdown implementation which causes responses to be considerably longer and not near as pretty as their Reddit counterparts.
