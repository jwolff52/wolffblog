			is a twitch chat moderation bot written in Java using <a href="http://www.jibble.org/pircbot.php">PIrcBot</a>. I am no longer actively working on this project. The project is approximately 60% complete with majority of the functionality implementation left to be done on the Web frontend. There is also a sister-project <a href="http://github.com/WeeboBot/DWeeboBot">DWeeboBot</a> which is the Discord variation on the bot itself. This project uses <a href="http://github.com/austinv11/Discord4J">Discord4J</a> to communicate with the Discord API and was started in September of 2016. It is still in the early stages of development.

			is an announcement plugin that I built early on in my Java programming days for <a href="https://bukkit.org">Craftbukkit</a> servers. The plugin went through several major rewrites as I learned better practices for writing more efficient code. It stands today as the closest I have ever come to "finishing" a project.
